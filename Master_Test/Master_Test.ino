Based on Wire Reader Master by Nicholas Zambetti <http://www.zambetti.com>

This sketch is designed to be loaded onto the master device in the system and reads from the slave tipping bucket counter which is loaded with the Salve_TippingBucket_Test.ino
firmware. This program simply reads the number of tips every 2 seconds, then prints this value to the serial monitor.

Connections to the salve device should be:
SCL -> Slave device SCL
SDA -> Slave device SDA
